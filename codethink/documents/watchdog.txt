Watchdogs
---------

Legacy tegra20
==============

To be reviewed.

Legacy tegra30
==============

The 2.6 kernel has two watchdogs in /dev/iomem and has them configured
in the kernel with the following options:

CONFIG_TEGRA_WATCHDOG=y
CONFIG_TEGRA_WATCHDOG_ENABLE_ON_PROBE=y

60005088-6000508f : tegra_wdt
  60005088-6000508f : tegra_wdt
60005100-6000511f : tegra_wdt
  60005100-6000511f : tegra_wdt

And one node for /dev/watchdog

From reading the source, these two /proc/iomem entries are acting as one
watchdog, as the drivers/watchdog/tegra_wdt.c requires two IO regions
and one interrupt.

Kernel 4.4
==========

The watchdog has not yet been tested.


Issues
======

4.4 does not have a CONFIG_TEGRA_WATCHDOG_ENABLE_ON_PROBE facility,
so this will require a workaround either in userspace or kernel.
