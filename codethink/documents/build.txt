TS001 Kernel Build
==================

To build the kernel, setup the build environment on the system for targeting
an ARMv7.

The build steps are close to the steps to build a standard kernel. The zImage
produced from this can then be passed to the quickloader tool to make an image
that can be booted on the kernel.

$ make ts001_defconfig
$ make Image zImage tegra30-tesla-cid.dtb

Boot the kernel (CID)
=====================

To make an image that is bootable on the CID unit, use the quickloader
tool to make a suitable boot image and then copy it to the CID as for
the old kernel.

The quickloader tool is in a separate git tree with documentation about
how to use it.

Use of zImage
=============

The build is currently using zImage as the uncompressor has the necessary
code included in it for appended device-tree support and the ATAGs-to-DT
updates.

Using zImage will have a performance penalty over quickboot's on-the-fly
lzf decompression, but avoids having to write an wrapper around the kernel
Image file that does the ATAG conversion to FDT or updating quickboot to
load and manipulate FDT files.
