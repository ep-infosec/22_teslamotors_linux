Booting
=======

For more information about how to boot, see the quickloader tool that is used
to wrap the kernel image.

Issues
------

- Command line currently is limited to 1024 characters, which quickboot is
  getting close to already. If this limit is reached, the atags->fdt process
  will fail to update the commandline in the device-tree, and thus anything
  quickboot passes is lost.

- Currently due to the issues of atag->fdt conversion being in the compressed
  loader, we have to boot zImage. This means both quickboot and the kernel are
  decompressing data. For performance, this will need to be fixed.
