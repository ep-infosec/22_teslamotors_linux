Making a release
================

The pre-requisite for a release is all the necessary source merged onto the
master branch in the gitlab and internal git servers. This source should
already have been built and tested as part of the development process.

The process is as so:

- Update the ts001 defconfig CONFIG_LOCALVERSION
- Create a branch for the release
- Run the release tool and verify it builds
- Push new branch to gitlab
- Notify everyone of the new release

Updated ts001_defconfig (and ts001_ic_defconfig) CONFIG_LOCALVERSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Update the arch/arm/configs/{ts001_defconfig,ts001_ic_defconfig} files
to change the CONFIG_LOCALVERSION entry to have the release date of the
release.


This should be in the form of:
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-release-<date>"

eg:
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-release-28oct2016"

Once this is done, commit the files with a commit message saying the
update is for the release.


Create a branch for the release
-------------------------------

The branch should be called release/<date>
eg: release/28oct2016


Run the release tool and verify it builds
-----------------------------------------

The release checking script is codethink/release-check.sh and will run some
basic checks on the release (such as 


Push the branch to gitlab
-------------------------

Use git to push the branch


Notify everyone of the new release
----------------------------------

There is a script to help prepare the release report:

codethink/mkreport.sh release/23sep2016 release/28oct2016

Add a list of things the release fixes, or other notes and send to the
relevant people and lists.
